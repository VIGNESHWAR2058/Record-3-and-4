Algorithm: Remove Function

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Get index from the user.

Step 3: Check the condition
  If (index < 0 || index >= size) then
    Go to Step 4
  Else
    Go to Step 5

Step 4: Print "Invalid index"
  Go to Step 10

Step 5: Set i = index

Step 6: Check the condition
  If i < size - 1 then
    Go to Step 7
  Else
    Go to Step 8

Step 7:
  Shift the elements to the left by one position:
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    Repeat this step until all elements after the deleted index are shifted.

Step 8:
  Decrease the array size by one:
    size = size - 1

Step 9:
  Print "Element deleted at index" followed by the value of index.

Step 10: Stop
