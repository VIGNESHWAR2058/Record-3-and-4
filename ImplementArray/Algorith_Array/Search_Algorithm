Algorithm: Search Function

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Initialize i = 0

Step 3: Check the condition
  If i < size, then go to Step 4
  Else go to Step 8

Step 4: Check if the current array element matches the search key
  If arr[i] == key, then go to Step 7
  Else go to Step 5

Step 5: Increment i by 1
  i = i + 1

Step 6: Go back to Step 3 (Repeat the checking process for the next element)

Step 7: Print "Element found at index" followed by the value of i
  Go to Step 9

Step 8: Print "Element not found"

Step 9: Stop
